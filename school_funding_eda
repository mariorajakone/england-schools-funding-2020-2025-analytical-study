Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

1. Downloaded Files into folder, then one-by-one I imported them into SQL. As there were quite a few columns, it was easier to use the Import/Export wizard to do that process

2. Some of the columns were too long, so the wizard automatically suggested the columns names for those.

3. The wizard also suggested the data types to set each column too. Some datatypes were incorrect so those were changed.

4. In the original files, I created copies so I could do some quality checks on them. The checks included MAX Length, MIN Length, Negative Values, Non-Numeric columns, Blank Rows and Floats. I also did this so that when I set the size of the field, some records will not be truncated.

5. The wizard returned warnings that some fields may contain NULLS and the data will be missing. Made a note of these fields.

6. When the data had been loaded, I did a rowcount and compared that to the original file row count.

7. Using the list of fields that may contain NULLs, I queried the table for the NULLs and cross checked that will the original source files.

Common issues:
- Interger/Floats fields containing 'Not Available', '*', 'z', 'x'. Happy for these to be converted to NULL values
- 1 row had a negative value
- 1 row had DIV+/0 which is most likely the result of copying a calculation where trying to divide by 0 calculation
- Some parts of the source were formatted differently, so had to set it all to the same format
- When converting a decimal number/float into an interger field, it converts to NULL
- 1 column had issues with it's data properties, so it just need a re-insert seemed to solve that

In Tableau tried to used Merge Columns function, as it did not recognise similar columns
The field names used in recent year's data has better names

- I found some of the Local Authority names were duplicated
- Created Sets for th LAs
